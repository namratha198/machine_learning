**Wine quality prediction project**:

Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes.
Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and heat.
Wine quality is the result of a complex set of interactions, which include geological and soil variables, climate, 
and many variables, climate, and many viticultural decisions.
In this project we determine the quality of wine by using the available Dataset using the model of Logistic Regression.
